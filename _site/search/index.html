        "content": "Simplicity……delivers your site fast. No Javascript/jQuery needed.…offers flexible styling of your content.…helps you and is well-documented.…is highly customizable and offers Tumblr-like postings.…is stylish with beautiful typography.IntroductionThere are lots of great themes for Jekyll to start a new blog, portfolio or website. Either these themes are bloated because they use Bootstrap, Foundation, jQuery or they are so minimal, that it doesn’t make fun to use them.  SpeedSimplicity goes a different path: Webpages built with Simplicity are superfast without unnecessary clutter unless you need it. Your readers will love your site because HTML- and CSS-files are minified and only a few requests are needed to load the site. If you don’t go crazy on images, it will be the fastest website possible.CustomizationWhen I built my first official theme called Feeling Responsive I wanted to built a flexible site built on-top of Foundation. The main goal was to deliver a theme to produce high quality site. I use it for my clients and it works fine. Simplicity benefits from this. But I wanted and needed a blog which is even fast without unnecessary clutter and foremost no Javascript.What I like best about SimplicityI adore minimalism. I love blogs with reduced interfaces which concentrate on content, speed and typography. Even when I visit these blogs with a bad mobile connection, they deliver content and user experience fast. And I figured out a way to reduce the amount of work to be done, when you start blogging. That’s why Simplicity was born. To start a post, you just have to add one line of front matter:---title: New Posting---Then start writing.Beef it up!Minimalism and simplicity don’t stand for an option-less theme. On the contrary! You can style your content quickly in many ways. Simplicity allows you to use additional front matter variables, but you don’t need them. You want to post a video? Just add…youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pQAWOCofXo…and the theme uses the variable to add the video on top of your headline. You like subheadines, like I do? Add…subheadline: Webdesign…and Simplicity adds it.You want an image on top of your article? Just add…image: death-to-the-stock-photography-3457.jpgAnd refine it with a caption and/or link if needed:caption: Death to Stock Photographycaption_url: http://deathtothestockphoto.com/",

To customize your typography settings just open _sass/_04_typography.scss and make your adjustements.The Elements of Typographic Style  »I do not think of type as something that should be readable. It should be beautiful.«Ed BenguiatFor too long typographic style and its accompanying attention to detail have been overlooked by website designers, particularly in body copy. In years gone by this could have been put down to the technology, but now the web has caught up. The advent of much improved browsers, text rendering and high resolution screens, combine to negate technology as an excuse.Robert Bringhurst’s book The Elements of Typographic Style is on many a designer’s bookshelf and is considered to be a classic in the field. Indeed the renowned typographer Hermann Zapf proclaims the book to be a must for everybody in the graphic arts, and especially for our new friends entering the field.In order to allay some of the myths surrounding typography on the web, I have structured this website to step through Bringhurst’s working principles, explaining how to accomplish each using techniques available in HTML and CSS. The future is considered with coverage of CSS3, and practicality is ever present with workarounds, alternatives and compromises for less able browsers.At the time of writing, this is a work in progress. I am adding to the site in the order presented in Bringhurst’s book, one principle at a time.I am excluding those principles which are not relevant to the Web or that do not require a technical explanation. Unfortunately this excludes the entire opening chapter, the Grand Design, which I heartily recommend you read as it lays down the foundations, philosophy and approach to good typography in any medium. If you were to take any working principle from the Grand Design, it would be this: Give full typographical attention even to incidental details.Now start with Rhythm &amp; Proportion or dip into the Table of Contents and enjoy pushing a few boundaries to create websites of real typographical worth.This excerpt was taken from webtypography.netTypographical ElementsHere you’ll find the complete list of HTML5-Tags and this is how they look like.&lt;hr&gt; Horizontal Line&lt;pre&gt; Displaying Code&lt;html&gt;    &lt;head&gt;        &lt;title&gt;Code Blocks&lt;/title&gt;    &lt;/head&gt;    &lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; QuotationEverything happens for a reason.
