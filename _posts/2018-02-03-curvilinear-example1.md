Curvilinear Problem Example 2

A car starts from rest at point A and increases its speed at a constant rate as it enters a curve. The magnitude of the total acceleration of the car as it passes point B, which is $$\frac{400}{3}  m$$ along the curve from point A, is $$2.5 \frac{m}{s^2}$$. The radius of curvature at point B is 200 m.

a.) Determine the normal and tangential components of the acceleration at point B

b.) If the tangential acceleration at point B is directed downward to the right at an angle of $$36.87^\circ$$ below the horizontal and the normal acceleration is also directed downward, determine the rectangular components of the acceleration at point B.

**SOLUTION:**

***Step 1: Draw***

Just like in any of our problems, we try to visualize first the problem before solving it.
